3. IRVArchitecture
ExistingBGPsecurityapproacheshavenotbeenwidely
deployed; the reasons include limited abilityto be incre-
mentallydeployed,high computationalcosts,andthein-
feasibility of modifying the vast installed base of BGP
implementations. Recognizingthese limitations, wepro-
pose the Interdomain Routing Validation (IRV) architec-
ture. UsedinconjunctionwithBGP, IRVisusedtovali-
dateBGPdataandacquireadditionalroutinginformation

3.1.Approach
IRVcombinesfeaturesofS-BGPandtheInternetRout-
ing Registry. Like S-BGP, IRV allows autonomous sys-
temstoconfirm(attest)thattheyannouncedorpropagated
particularroutes.UnlikeS-BGP,validationinformationis
not carried in UPDATE messages. Instead, we introduce
the notion of an Interdomain Routing Validator (IRV).
Each participating AS designates an IRV responsible for
answering queriesfrom other ASes. Usersof thesystem
querytheIRVtovalidatereceivedBGPdataortoacquire
additional route-relevant information. IPsec or TLS can
be used to ensure the integrity, authenticity, and timeli-
nessofthequeriesandresponses.Figure1illustratesthis;

is acquired (generally by another IRV or net-
work management element – NME) via query-
ingtheIRVrepresentingtherelevantAS.
The essence of the IRV architecture is a decentralized
query system. Participating ASes establish an IRV to
speakauthoritatively(throughqueryinterfaces)aboutthe
local network status and configuration. The IRV pro-
vides access to static and dynamic data through a query
interface. Static data can include routing policy(such as
thatcurrentlyexchangedusingRPSLandcentralizedreg-
istries), community information, or data relating to peer-ing. The dynamic data can include received BGP route
announcements, the current routing tables, or a descrip-
tion of advertisedroutes. Queries are used to implement
featuresnotcurrentlypresentinBGP.
3.2.TheIRV
EachIRVisaserver,deployedasadedicatedmachine
(orsetofmachines)withintheASthatitrepresents.How-
ever, this need not be the case. The only requirement is
thatthosethatwishtocontacttheIRVcorrespondingtoa
particularAScandoso(weconsiderthedesignofadis-
tributedservicethatmapsASNs toIRVs inSection3.4).
Regardless of how the IRV is contacted, it must provide
an interfaceby which external entities can query routing
data.
TheIRVarchitecturedoesnotmandatethekindsofdata
supported by an IRV. ASes are free to include or omit
supportforanyroutinginformation. Bydesign,ASescan
extendthequery/repositoryschemaeasily(seeSection4).
We expect that different schemata will evolve within the
communities in which IRV is deployed. The following

NotethattheIRVneednotresponduniformlytoallre-
questers; an IRV may be configured to restrict access to
particular data to a list of authorized requesters. While
we do not mandate that the IRV authenticate the source
of queries, we view authentication as essential to future
routing environments. The BGP model requires that an

3.3.UsingIRV
The main use for IRV is as a way of validating BGP
data. Origin information can be (na¨ıvely) validated by
querying the origin AS identifiedin each UPDATE mes-

TheauthenticityofareceivedAS PATHbycanbever-
ifiedbyqueryingeachnodeinthepath. However,itmay
bebeneficialtocachepreviouslyacquiredpolicyandroute
information. These cached values can be used to avoid
revalidation of stable information (e.g., origin informa-

IRVdoesnotmandatewhenqueriesaresent. However,
thealgorithmchosenbyanASwilldeterminethecostas-

that partiesdonotneedvalidationinformationwith each

The config section extends RPSL by standardizing
BGP community information. This section assigns
semanticmeaningtovariouscommunityvalues(e.g.,
as is currently done through RPSL “remarks” at-

monly used, but nonstandard, BGP communities:
“no announce” and “prepend”. A “no announce”
community indicates that a particular route is not
to be announced to a specific peer. A “prepend”
communityindicatesthataspecifiedASNshouldbe

number of times the ASN should be prepended is
supplied.
