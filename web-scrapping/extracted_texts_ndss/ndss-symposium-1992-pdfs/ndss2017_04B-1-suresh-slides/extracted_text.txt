 Bob does not know σ  Alice does not know x
1-σ
x σ
0
1-out-of-2 OT
x x
1 σ
(x , x ) σ = 0 or 1
0 1
 1 out of n OT: The sender has n messages instead of two (Brassard et. al. [87])
OT is complete for MPC (Kilian [88])

 OT cannot be based on symmetric-key primitives alone [IR89]
 Small no. of “base” OTs + symmetric-key operations = Large no. of OTs

 Adversary sets the D matrix as follows :
c
with first bit flipped
1
D =
 The 1st mask in the 1st OT will be of the form:
H(1, q  (C ⦿ S)) = H(1, t  (D  C )⦿ S)
1 1 1 1 1
q = t (C ⦿ S)

1 i
= H(1, t  [ s ,0, … , 0 ] )

 Given prior knowledge on x , adversary can find s with
1,1 1
two queries to H
Ajith Suresh | NDSS 2017 Feb 28, 2017 7Formulating the problem
 1st mask in the 1st 1-out-of-n OT :
HH((11,, qq  ((CC ⦿⦿ SS)))) == HH((11,, tt  (( ((CD CC )) ⦿⦿ SS ))

Requirement : Ensure that rows of D matrix are codewords q = t (C ⦿ S)

Comparison with KK13
• Communication Complexity :
0.028% overhead
• Runtime : 3% - 6% overhead
(in both LAN and WAN)
