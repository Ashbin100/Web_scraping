• User Authentication:
– Confirm the identity of the user.
• Sensitive data:
– Medical records
– Bank account
– Personal location information
– and so on …
3 School of Computer Science and EngineeringGait Recognition using Wearable Sensors
• Gait recognition:
– Identifying an individual by his/her unique walking pattern.
• Using wearable sensors, accelerometer, to capture gait patterns.
4 School of Computer Science and EngineeringChallenge: Power Constraints
• Limited Battery Life
– Small form factor
– High Energy Consumption:
• Powering motion sensors
• Powering micro-controller (MCU)
• Powering wireless communication unit
5 School of Computer Science and EngineeringKinetic Energy Harvesting (KEH)
• A new vison: Kinetic Energy Harvesting-powered wearable
system.
– Powering wearable devices using ambient kinetic motions.
6 School of Computer Science and EngineeringKinetic Energy Harvesting (cont.)
• Practical products:

7 School of Computer Science and EngineeringKinetic Energy Harvesting (cont.)
• Practical products:
Shoe sole based energy harvester
8 School of Computer Science and EngineeringMotivations
• Accelerometer-based gait recognition is energy consuming
– Continuous data sampling -> High energy consumption
– Especially for resource-constrained wearable devices
• Kinetic energy harvesting is promising in powering wearable devices.
• Our Idea:
– Gait recognition using the voltage signal generated by the KEH!
• Intuition:
– If humans have unique walking patterns, then the corresponding patterns of the
harvested power from KEH should also be unique.

• Robustness to Gait variations:
– Variations over time (one week)
Accuracy of authentication in different days is
approximately 5% lower than that of the same day
authentication.
19 School of Computer Science and EngineeringEvaluation results (cont.)
• Robustness to Gait variations:
– Different environments:
