February 4, 1999 NDSS ’99 2Problem Definition
suspected report recv’d notification recv’d
compromise reported made available
• Period of undetected key compromise
• Dilemma
– Originator signed message during period?
– Originator did not sign message during period?
February 4, 1999 NDSS ’99 3Methods of Compromise
• Algorithmic attack
• Implementation failure
• Insider attack
• Brute-force attack
February 4, 1999 NDSS ’99 4Current Solutions
• Time stamping of signature
– message was signed before time t
• Revocation of verification certificate
– occurs after compromise detection or suspicion
• Undetected compromise not resolved
February 4, 1999 NDSS ’99 5Current Solutions (cont’d)
• Redundant mechanism
– threshold signatures
– proactive signatures, certification
• multiple signers
• don’t necessarily preclude all attacks
February 4, 1999 NDSS ’99 6Current Solutions (cont’d)
• Limit exposure from compromise
– limit period of potential forgery, e.g., certificate
expiry or revocation
– proactive certification
– limitation of signing privilege, i.e., type of
signatures
– limitation of number of signatures
February 4, 1999 NDSS ’99 7Proposed Solution
TR
[1]
[2]
[3]
originator verifier
• [1] request authentication for particular sig
• [2] receive second-level assurance
• [3] forward sig & second-level assurance
February 4, 1999 NDSS ’99 8Properties
• Independence
– one attack doesn’t necessarily imply second
• binding
– signature bound to second-level request and
response
• permits authentication
– allows identification of the originator
February 4, 1999 NDSS ’99 9Second Secret Solution
• Shared key solution
– Setup: originator u and TR share a key K
– TR request: For signature c, u sends (c,
z=E (c)) to TR
K
– TR response: r=sig (c) is returned to u and
T
verified
• Alternatives: secondary signature; Lamport
keys
February 4, 1999 NDSS ’99 10Synchronization Solution
• Does not prevent signature production (first
or second level) in case of signature key
compromise, but
– on its own, it allows detection by an honest user
– with other measures, can prevent signature
acceptance
• Alternatives: output of one-way function;
time variant
February 4, 1999 NDSS ’99 11Synchronization Solution
(cont’d)
• Time of last signature
– Setup: originator u and TR share a time t
0
– TR request: For signature c , u sends (c t ) to
i i, i-1
TR (t verified)
i-1
– TR response: r=sig (c , t , t ) is returned to u
T i i-1 i
and verified
February 4, 1999 NDSS ’99 12CHIP/COPE
• Cooling-off period (COPE)
• Check-in period (CHIP)
• Forgery is detectable prior to end of COPE
– signatures can subsequently be rolled back
check-in
COPE
February 4, 1999 NDSS ’99 13CHIP/COPE (cont’d)
• Time of last signature
– TR request: For signature c , u sends (c t ) to
i i, i-1
TR (t verified)
i-1
– CHIP verification: TR ensures that t - t < t
i i-1
where t = length(CHIP)
– TR response: r=sig (c , t , t ) is returned to u
T i i-1 i
and verified
– Signature recipient waits till end of COPE, i.e.,
till time t +t
i
February 4, 1999 NDSS ’99 14Concluding Remarks
• Proposed solution
– second-level authentication (independent
secret; synchronization)
– increases likelihood of detection
– permits rollback of forged signatures
• Suitability
– applicable to automated, high-valued
transactions, ...
