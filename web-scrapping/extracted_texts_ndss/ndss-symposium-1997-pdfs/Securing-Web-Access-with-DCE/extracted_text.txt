1 Gradient Technologies, Inc.Client/Server Applications -
Can They Meet the Demand
(cid:132) Long Development Cycles
– Application development typically > 1 year
– Development for multiple Client Platforms
– Limited distributed computing developers
(cid:132) Administration Nightmare
– Installation and administration of many and complex desktop
client applications
2 Gradient Technologies, Inc.Internet/Web - Why Such
Rapid Acceptance?
(cid:132) Standards based networking
– “Standard” Web Browsers and Servers
– TCP / IP everywhere
(cid:132) Cheap and easy access
(cid:132) Quick Application and Information
Deployment
– Tools easy to learn
– Browsers easy to use
– Applications easy to deploy
3 Gradient Technologies, Inc.Distributed Infrastructure
(cid:132) Apply heterogeneous distributed computing
infrastructure to Web accesses
(cid:132) Location independence of servers via directory
service
(cid:132) Security infrastructure that provides:
– strong user authentication (Kerberos)
– data protection (integrity and privacy)
– flexible and convenient authorization model

5 Gradient Technologies, Inc.Authorization Model
(cid:132) Authorization performed by the server which
controls the resource being protected
(cid:132) Authorization model based on identity including
group membership
(cid:132) Authorization information contained in an ACL
using a standard format
(cid:132) DCE ACL model is extended to support sparse
ACLs
6 Gradient Technologies, Inc.Sparse ACLs
(cid:132) Not necessary to create a separate ACL for each
object in the hierarchy
(cid:132) Objects without specific ACLs have an inherited
ACL - ACL of superior object
(cid:132) Inheritance is evaluated at access time as
opposed to creation time
(cid:132) Deleting an ACL makes it an inherited ACL
(cid:132) Real ACLs can be created - inferior objects inherit
new ACL immediately

Inherited ACL
Real ACL
8 Gradient Technologies, Inc.Technology to Product
(cid:132) DCE Web technology has been implemented as a
product called WebCrusader
(cid:132) Based on work done by the Open Group
Research Institute
