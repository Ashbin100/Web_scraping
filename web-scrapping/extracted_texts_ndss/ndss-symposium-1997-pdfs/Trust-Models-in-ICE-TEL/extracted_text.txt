l To verify a digital signature, I need
– the signer’s public key
– to be sure who “owns the public key”
» (i.e. who knows the corresponding private key)
l Certification
– Third party assertion of “who owns which
public key”
l Which third parties do I trust?
– On what basis do they make their assertion?
– What guarantees do they give? Liability?

l Third party issues certificate, comprising:
– Who is doing the asserting (issuer)
– Who is the subject of the assertion
– What is being asserted (public key)
– The small print (certification policy)
– Digital signature
l Syntactic check of certificates tells me if the
public key is accurate
l Semantic check of policies tells me who the
public key belongs to
– or what can be done with it

l Supports diverse security domains
– single users
– simple groups or small organisations
– complex organisations
l Supports organic growth, allowing
reorganisation of domains
l Trust between domains is by choice, and
need not be mutual or transitive
l No central infrastructure

l Each security domain contains trust points
l A trust point is a CA with an advertised
policy
l Security domains interlinked by cross-
certification among trust points
l User advertises certification path to trust
point
l Trust point advertises the cross-certificates it
has issued
