Simon Birnbach, Wi-Fly?: Detecting Privacy Invasion Attacks by Consumer Drones, 2017 NDSS 9/20Statistical Tests
Attacker has to:
…overcome physical access restrictions
¨
à Drone is flying high above ground
…establish LOS to the window
¨
à changes of multipath effects
à we expect far less multipath effects due to strong LOS
component (compared with ground-based transmitters)
…move towards the window
¨
à RSS increases as drone approaches
Detection method based on statistical tests:
n
Testing for flying: Closer to free-space propagation than non-flying
¨
transmitters
Testing for approaching & movement: significant RSS changes as
¨
distance to receiver varies
Simon Birnbach, Wi-Fly?: Detecting Privacy Invasion Attacks by Consumer Drones, 2017 NDSS 10/20Statistical Tests
Free-space propagation (FSP)
n
RSS depends on distance and receiver noise
¨
Only noise varies in short time frame w (<0.1s)
¨
s
Movement
n
More distance variation than noise in longer interval w (>1s)
¨
l
Compute standard deviation of RSS measurements
n
Noise threshold t
