Towards Implicit Visual Memory-Based AuthenticationTypes of Authentication
Competing requirements of security and usability.[1]
Common Factors:
1) Knowledge (Password, PIN)
2) Biometrics (Fingerprint, Face)
3) Possession (Token)
Reinforced by:
- 2-Factor Authentication
- Risk-based Authentication
- Continuous Authentication

Evaluation of Web Authentication Schemes. (SP '12)Knowledge-based Authentication
Example: Passwords
1) Create a secure password
2) Remember the password
3) Provide at time of authentication
All steps involved are hard for users.
High cognitive burden
Password reuse
Password resets
3 San Diego, February 27th, 2017 | NDSS ’17 |Fallback Authentication
Used to regain access if the primary
means of authentication is lost!
Different:
- Memorability
- Rate limiting
- Time required to authenticate
 Often the weakest link in the chain
(Sarah Palin, Mat Honan, …)
 We need to design better systems!

15 San Diego, February 27th, 2017 | NDSS ’17 |Mooney Images
Thresholded two-tone images showing a single object.
Recognition:
- Hard to recognize at first sight
- Sudden recognition (aha! / Eureka-effect)
- Intrinsically / By marking the contour of object / Showing the original image
Value for Authentication?
- Trigger brain processes involved in implicit memory.
16 San Diego, February 27th, 2017 | NDSS ’17 |Implicit Memory
Unintentional recollection of information.
Can be observed in habitual behavior,
i.e., riding a bike, playing an instrument.
We are not aware of the information
stored in our memory.
We can trigger the implicit memory by a
process called priming. Ludmer et al. Neuron 2011 [3]

Memory of Induced Perceptual Insight. (Neuron '11)MooneyAuth
Relieves users of the cognitive burden of remembering an explicit password.
1) Enrollment / Priming:
- Prime on set of random Mooney images.
- We show every image twice.
2) Authentication:
- Primed + non-primed Mooney images are presented to the user.
- User is requested to label the images.
- Scoring algorithm based on surprisal of observed events.
- User authenticated: score > threshold.

Primed + non-primed images are presented.
Task:
User has to label the image
or
skip by pressing the button.
Assumption:
User labels primed images more often
correctly (and faster).
20 San Diego, February 27th, 2017 | NDSS ’17 |Scoring
- Score derived from the self-information (surprisal) of the observed events.
- There are four events that can occur:
Correct Label Incorrect Label
Primed p 1-p
i i
Non-Primed n 1-n
i i
I(E )  log P(correct | primed)
primed,correct 2
 A “good” Mooney image has a high p , but low n value.
i i
21 San Diego, February 27th, 2017 | NDSS ’17 |Attacker Model
The security does not rely on
secrecy of the hidden object.
We provide the attacker with the
solution for every Mooney image:
- Mooney image
- Original grayscale image
- Correct label
The scheme can not be broken by
computer vision algorithms!
22 San Diego, February 27th, 2017 | NDSS ’17 |Attacker Model
Secret: Knowing which images the user was primed on.
During enrollment images are
selected by the server:
- No user selection bias
- Random guessing
- Rate limit guessing attempts
