However, public-key digital signatures can be costly.
Generating and verifying public-key digital signatures are
time-consuming. Inroutingprotocolcontext, message ex-
change among routershappens very frequentlyand digital
signatures have to be generated and verified in real time.
Inlink-stateroutingprotocols,verificationofdigitalsigna-
tures can be more of a problem, since each message sig-
natureisverifiedbyalargenumberofrouters. Whenlinks
andnodesfluctuate,thepainisparticularlyfeltsincerouters

In this paper, we proposesome protocolsthat can sub-
stantially reduce the computational costs of using digital
signatures. Ourapproachesuseone-timedigitalsignatures

asfollows. InSection2,wegivesomeintroductiontoone-

2.One-timeSignatureSchemes
One-timesignatureschemesarebasedonapublicfunc-
tion
f
thatiseasytocomputebutcomputationallyinfeasible
toinvert,forsuitabledefinitionsof“easy”and“infeasible”.
Such functions are called one-way functions (OWF) and
were first employed for use in loginprocedures by Need-
ham [39]. If the output of a one-way functionis of fixed
length,itiscalledaone-wayhashfunction(OWHF).More
precisely,thedefinitionofOWHFisgivenas[3]:

arbitrary length or a predetermined length, to strings of a

and
y
suchthat
h ( y )
h ( x ) = ,but
x 6= y
.
Some authors describe the third property as collision-
resistance.
One-timesignatureschemewasfirstintroducedbyLam-
port [19, 8]. For signing a single bit, choose as the se-
cret key two values
x 1
and
x 2
(representing ‘0’ and ‘1’)
atrandomandpublishtheirimages underaone-wayfunc-
tion
y 1 = f ( x 1 )
and
y 2 = f ( x 2 )
as thepublickey. These
x
’s and
y
’s are called secret key components and public
key components, respectively. To sign a single bit mes-
sage, reveal the pre-image correspondingto the actual ‘0’
or ‘1’. For signing longer messages, several instances of
thisschemecanbeused.
Motivated by Lamport’s approach, many researchers
havesubsequentlyproposedmoreefficientone-timesigna-
ture schemes. Merkle [26, 25] proposed an improvement
whichreducesthenumberofpublickeycomponentsinthe
Lamportmethodbyalmosttwo-fold. Insteadofgenerating
two
x
’sandtwo
y
’s foreach bitofthemessage, thesigner
cangenerateonlyone
x
andone
y
valueof
foreach bitofthemes-
sage to be signed. When one of the bits in the message
tobesignedisa‘1’, thesignerreleases thecorresponding
x
;butwhenthebittobesignedisa‘0’,thesigner
releases nothing. Because this allows the receiver to pre-
tendthathe didnotreceive someof the
x
’s, andtherefore
to pretend that some of the ‘1’ bits in thesigned message
were ‘0’, thesigner mustalso sign countof the‘0’ bitsin
themessage. Now,whenthereceiverpretendsthata‘1’bit
wasactuallya‘0’bit,hemustalsoincreasethevalueofthe
count field, which can’t be done. Because the count field
hasonly
lo g 2 n
bitsinit,thesignaturesizeisdecreased by
almostafactoroftwo,i.e.,from
2 n
to
n + b lo g 2 n c + 1
.
As an example, if we wished to signthe 8-bitmessage
‘0100 1110’ we would first count the number of ‘0’ bits
(thereare 4) and then append a 3-bitcount field (with the
value4)totheoriginal8-bitmessage producingthe11-bit
message‘01001110100’whichwewouldsignbyreleasing
x [2 ]
,
x [5 ]
,
x [6 ]
,
x [7 ]
and
x [9 ]
. Thereceiver cannotpretend
thathedidnotreceive
x [2 ]
,becausetheresultingerroneous
message ‘0000 1110 100’ would have 5 ‘0’s in it, not 4.
Similarly,pretendinghedidnotreceive
x [9 ]
wouldproduce
theerroneousmessage‘01001110000’inwhichthecount
field indicates that there shouldbe no ‘0’s at all. There is
nocombinationof

’sthatthereceivercouldpretendnotto
havereceived thatwouldlethimconcoctalegitimatemes-
sage.
Winternitz[25]proposedanimprovementwhichreduces
the signature size by several folds at the expense of in-
creased computationaleffort. In Winternitz’smethod, the
OWF is applied to two secret key components iteratively
fora fixed number oftimes, resultinginatwo-component
publickey. Meyer and Matyas [27] proposed as a further
improvementtousemorethantwochainsoffunctioneval-
uations. Their scheme was generalized further in [9] and
laterin[38]toaschemewith
l
chainsoflength
k
wherethe
signatures consist of onenode in each chain such that the
totalsum ofthelevels ofthesenodes (withintheirchains)
isconstant.
The schemes described so far can only be used to sign
asinglemessage. Merkle[25,26]proposedso-calledtree-
authentication schemes for signing several messages con-
secutively with a single publickey. Multiplekeys can be
putontheleavesofanauthenticationtreeandauthenticated
throughthepathsofthetree. Vaudenay[38]showedanim-
provedschemerequiringlessmemory. Bleichenbacherand
Maurer[5,6,7]formalizedtheconceptofone-timesigna-
tures using directed acyclic graphs and proved some the-
oretical results. These schemes for signing multiplemes-
sages usea singlepublickey for verification, a featurere-
sembles public-keycryptography. However, itis achieved
athighercomputationalcosts.

In order to sign more than one message, we need mul-

ever,ifwekeepalargenumberofthesesets,thestoragere-

Thestoragerequirementforone-timesecretkeycompo-

singlevaluebygeneratingallthesecretkeycomponentsin
a pseudo-random fashionfrom a single secret key as used
in[34,4].
8.ComparisonbetweenCOSPandIOSP
Generally speaking, IOSP signature verification runs
twice as fast as COSP and IOSP uses less memory for
storingtheone-timesecretkeycomponentsandpublickey
components. However, on average the signature size of
COSP is roughlyhalf ofthat ofIOSP, e.g., 2KB forIOSP
and1KBforCOSPusingMD5.
Another attraction of COSP is that if router A misses
somemessages fromrouterB, Acan easilycatch upsince
future secret key components can be authenticated using
past public key components. Whereas, in IOSP if router
A misses a message from router B, they have to re-setup.
Therefore, COSP ismore tolerantofunreliablepacket de-
livery. However, COSP has to be used with timing con-
straints.
9. Applicability as Efficient Alternatives to
Public-keySignatures
In additionto securing routingmessages, our protocols
can be used as efficient alternatives to public-key digital
signatures for signing arbitrary messages. Our protocols
arenon-interactive,andhence,especiallyusefulforsigning
broadcastedmessageswitharelativelystableaudience.
Asageneralapproach,thewayourprotocolsbeingused
with public-key systems for message signing is similar to
