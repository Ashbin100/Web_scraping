• “Google Play requires developers to provide a valid privacy
policy when the app requests or handles sensi&ve user or
device informa&on.” (Google Play Developer E-Mail, Feb ’17)
• The California Online Privacy Protec&on Act also requires app
publishers to have a privacy policy and transparently disclose
data prac&ces (California Business and Professions Code
Sec&ons 22575-22579)
à System to evaluate how many apps have a privacy policy,
whether the policies follow privacy requirements, and analyze
discrepancies between apps and policies to increase transparency at

4/11 https://www.usableprivacy.org/What are privacy requirements?
1. Apps must have a privacy policy
2. Policies have to describe data prac&ces occurring in the apps
(e.g., describe how loca&on data is shared with third par&es)
and must not omit any prac&ce
3. Apps must follow the described prac&ces

• Help developers, app store owners, and regulators;
implement our system into their workflow
• Current system piloted by the Office of the California
APorney General
• Extensions towards other use cases, par&cularly, in the
emerging Internet of Things domain
