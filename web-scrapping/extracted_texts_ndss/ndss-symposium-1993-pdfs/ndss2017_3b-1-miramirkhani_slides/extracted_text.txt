unused domain. Apart from hiding advertising profits from the
domain owners [15], many domain parking companies have
been found to collaborate with dubious advertising networks
which do not hesitate to occasionally redirect a user to a
page with malware. In fact, Vissers et al., while researching
the types of ads that users who land on parked websites are
exposed to, discovered two pages which fit our definition of
a technical support scam [16]. To find a sufficient number of
parked domains that our crawlers can visit, we take advantage
of the fact that prior research has shown that domain parking is
the favorite monetization method of domain squatters [17]–[22].
Therefore, as long as we visit typosquatting variants of popular
twwitter.com
domain names, such as (note the duplication of
‘‘w’’
the character), the majority of our visits will end up on
domain parking companies which will redirect a fraction of
these visits to technical support scams.
Ad-based URL Shorteners. Ad-based URL shorteners are
services that allow the users who shorten URLs to make a
commission every time that other users visit their shortened
URLs. Instead of immediately redirecting the short-URL-
visiting users, ad-based URL shorteners force users to view
an ad for a few seconds, before they can proceed to the
intended, “long”, URL. Nikiforakis et al. studied the ecosystem
of ad-based URL shortening services and their ad-delivery
methods [23], finding a large percentage of malvertising.
Generality of our approach. Note that we are not claiming
that scammers explicitly collaborate with either domain-parking
agencies, or ad-based URL shorteners. Instead, we use these
two services as our gateway to malicious advertising, rather
than as a method for identifying specific advertisers. As such,
we argue that our methodology will be able to detect, with
equal probability, all scammers that are using advertising as a
way of attracting victims.
B. Tool design and implementation
Our tool for discovering and recording technical support
scams is called R (Robotic Victim). Our main objective
OBOVIC
is to collect as much data as possible about this highly profitable
underground business, in order to conduct a systematic study of
technical support scams and analyze their unique characteristics.
At the same time, a necessary condition for gathering technical-
support-related data is the development of a reliable and highly
available infrastructure, that will provide us with enough uptime
to be able to study temporal properties of technical support
scams. Figure 2 shows the high-level view of R , the
OBOVIC

tool with the technical support scam ecosystem. We describe
R ’s core components below:

Crawler. The Crawler is in charge of browsing and collecting
data for the given set of URLs and recording information
about the resulting pages. To address the requirements of our
study, we extended OpenWPM which is a generic web privacy
measurement platform [24]. More specifically, we implemented
a custom browser extension to instrument the browser so that
specific native JavaScript functions, like the aforementioned
alert
function, would be overwritten before loading a page, in
a way that allows us to record the frequency of calls and exact
messages displayed to users. In addition, our browser extension
ensured the modification of the browser’s user-agent properties

support scam pages, e.g., the locking of a user’s browser via

the use of the JavaScript-accessible, browser-provided

it to interact with these pages but not get trapped by them.
We deployed the R Crawler on three different sites
OBOVIC
(our campus, Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud [25], and on
Linode’s cloud [26]). We provided each instance with the
same set of 10,000 possible typosquatting domains, which we
obtained by applying the typosquatting models of Wang et
al. [18] on the top 200 websites according to Alexa, and a set
of 3,000 shortened URLs belonging to ten popular ad-based
URL shorteners. The crawler instances initiate the crawling
process at the same time each day and collect and store all
the aforementioned data. Note that R was originally

scams and we incorporated ad-based URL shorteners later in
our study. We denote the exact date while analyzing the data

Detector. The Detector Module identifies the pages that are
the most likely to be technical support scams based on a set of
heuristic rules. We examined several heuristics, such as, having
alert
a redirection chain, showing consecutive dialogues, the
presence of a phone number, and the presence of special
keywords. After observing approximately a week’s worth of
collected data, we designed our heuristic which minimized false
negatives and false positives as follows: If a page has any kind
of popup dialogue, we check its content using an empirically
constructed decision tree and based on the presence of carefully
chosen sets of keywords, we score the page and mark it as
malicious if the score is higher than a tuned threshold.
To gauge the accuracy of our heuristic, we use random
sampling to select three days (from the 250 days that are

Fig. 11: Distribution of the time duration between the beginning of
a call, and the time when technical support scammers presented us
with the pricing options for their services
before proceeding to search for infections. This was typically
done to convince us that spending money for the removal of
malware was worth the cost since it would allow us to keep
using our machine for many years before we would need to
purchase a new one.
Overall, while we were able to identify techniques commonly
used by scammers, we were impressed with the scammers’
creativity in finding status messages that were already present on
our system and attaching a infection meaning to them. Figure 10
shows how often scammers used two social engineering
techniques together. There, we use the recorded frequencies to
calculate their respective conditional probabilities.
Duration of calls. Figure 11 shows the distribution of the time
duration between the beginning of a technical support scam
call, and the time when a scammer offered his services in
exchange for money. The average duration of that interval is
17 minutes, and the distribution is approximately normal. In
only a few cases, the scammers first told us the amount of
money that they will be charging (around the second and third
minute of our conversation) and then proceeded to “diagnose”
our machine.
Overall, one can see that the scammers are by no means in
a hurry to convince users and defraud them. They take their
time to slowly guide their victims into installing a remote
administration tool, clicking through all the security dialogues,
and giving them access to their machines. Once they have
access, they slowly work their way through different Windows
tools, showing their output to users and interpreting that output
for them. It is likely that scammers know that the more time
they take to convince a user about an infection, the more
successful they will be when they ask for a compensation
for their services. Figure 11 also provides an indication of
the amount of work necessary in order to obtain real-world
data from technical support scam calls. Specifically, for the
60 calls recorded and analyzed we spent, during a one-month
period, more than 1,300 minutes (22 hours) just interacting
with scammers, excluding dropped calls, out-of-order numbers,
analysis of the recordings, and verification of our findings.
Since scammers control the vast majority of the conversation
(see sample transcripts in companion website [27]) we opine
that the distribution of time shown in Figure 11 will be
generalizable to the population of victims. Therefore, this
distribution can be of immediate value to telcos and the FTC.
Specifically, given a list of numbers operated by scammers,
telcos can straightforwardly produce metadata of their customer

±
should capture approximately 99.7% of all pre-charge calls. As
such, anyone interacting for more than 41 minutes, is likely a
defrauded victim.
Price of services. Once scammers felt confident that we were
convinced that we are in need of their help, they then informed
us about the price of their services. Most scammers offered us
two to three different options with support packages ranging
from a one-time fix, to multi-year support, ranging anywhere
from $69.99 to $999.99. Figure 12 shows the ECDF of the
amount requested, split in its minimum, average, and maximum
(average for any given scammer is the average price of all
offered support packages). The average support price across
all support packages and all scammers is $290.9 with most
scammers staying under $500 for all of their support packages.
The prices of support packages were structured in a way
where the middle one made the most financial sense. In fact,
the times that we pretended to be willing to purchase their
support and requested the cheapest option, the scammers would
typically try to reason with us that the middle one was a better
value-for-money offer. Interestingly, the price of services did
not correlate with the time that scammers spend convincing us
of our supposed infection (Pearson r=0.11).
Freelance scammers vs organized call centers. At the outset
of our study, we did not know whether technical support
scammers are individual freelancers who supplement their
income by single-handedly operating a technical support scam,
or are part of an organized call center. Through the process of
interacting with 60 different scammers, we are now convinced
that most, if not all, scammers are part of organized call centers.
Next to anecdotal evidence that we gathered during our
interactions (e.g. on one occasion, due to technical difficulties
with our VoIP software, we called the same number three times
in a row, and were greeted by a different person all three
times), we conducted the following experiment: We replayed
each recorded call and, instead of focusing on the scammer
talking to us, we instead focused on background noises. While
some scammers muted their microphones when they were not
speaking, the majority did not. On 62% of our calls, we were
able to hear other people in the background, often recognizing
phrases about security and malware that the scammer had just
