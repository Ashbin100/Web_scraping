1. Introduction
The use of widely distributed resources on the Inter-
net has strained existing network infrastructures. Until
recently, applications and services were targeted to envi-
ronments spanning few administrative domains support-
ing a relatively static user community. However, the ex-
plosion of new forms of communication has invalidated
manyofthebasicassumptionsuponwhichthesesystems
werebuilt. Thus,thedesignofthesesystems,andoftheir
security in particular, has recently come under consider-
ablescrutiny.
An approach addressing the requirements of these
(cid:3)
emerging applications and services is the use of policy.
Through policy, a system may address the (sometimes
conflicting) needs of all communication participants in
real time. Each session occurs within the context of a
shared policy defining the acceptable behavior and re-
quirements of its participants. Thus, rather than relying
solelyonthesystemdesignersornetworkadministration
to define service behavior,the interests ofall paritiesare
considered at the point at which communication occurs.
This paper considers a number of principles for the con-
structionofonekindofpolicy,securegroupcommunica-
tionpolicy.
We define a group security policy as a statement of
the entirety of security relevant parameters and facilities
usedtoimplementthegroup. Thisbestfitstheviewpoint
of policy as defining how security directs group behav-
ior,whoaretheentitiesallowedtoparticipate,andwhich
mechanismswillbeusedtoachievemissioncriticalgoals.
Note that this definition isnot restricted to electronically
distributedstatements,policyisoftentheresultofsystem

Thispaperconsidersthedefinitionandrequirementsof
security policies in groups. A number of principles for
thedesignofpolicyservicesingroupcommunicationare
identified. These principles are the result of a system-
atic analysis of the policy requirements unique to secure
groupsandthosecommontobothpeerandgroupcommu-
nication. Wereasonaboutthesecurityofarbitrarypolicy

2.2.PrinciplesofGroupPolicy
The direct application of policy approaches used in
peer-communication is unlikely to meet the needs of
groups. This is due in large part to fundamental differ-
encesbetweenpeerandgrouppolicies;grouppolicycon-
veys information about an association greater and more
abstract than its pair-wise counterpart. The following
textidentifiesandillustratesuniversalprinciplesresulting
fromouranalysisofgroupandpeercommunicationpoli-
cies.
Principle1: Enforcementofgrouppolicymustbecon-
sistentacrossagroup
While it may evolve over the course of a session, the
grouprequiresasingularpolicydefinition. Thisimpliesa
shared view of the participants and the security of appli-
cationcontent. Failuretooperateunderthesamesecurity
contextcanleadtovulnerableorincompatiblesolutions.
Similarly, policy implicitly requires trust among the
membership. Each member trusts that all participants
have been admitted and enforce the policy specification
correctly. If a consistent view of policycannot be estab-
lished, memberswill havenoway to infer this trust. We
have identified two facets of policy consistency: mecha-
nismequivalenceandsynchronization.
Two mechanisms are equivalent if

the same service (e.g., data confidentiality), and
(cid:12)(cid:13) (cid:10)

Session rekeying in peer communication is well de-
fined. The peer end-points actively participate in an ex-
change resulting in acceptance of the new key. Because

key can be unambiguous. The issues, design, and vul-
nerabilities of peer key exchanges have been thoroughly

Synchronization directly requires all received policies

Of course, any policy must contain some evidence of
its authenticity (i.e., policy verification). For example, a
